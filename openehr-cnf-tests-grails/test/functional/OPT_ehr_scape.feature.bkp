Feature: ADL 1.4 OPT Provisioning for EHRSCAPE
  As a REST API client, I want to manage OPTs by using the I_DEFINITION_ADL14
  so those are available for other services and components

#  Background: EHRSCAPE Server is running and doesn't have any OPTs
#    Given EHRSCAPE server is running
#      And current count of OPTs is 0

  #Scenario: EHRSCAPE Upload an ADL 1.4-based OPT
#    When the client uploads an OPT to the I_DEFINITION_ADL14 with template_id "encounter"
#    Then current count of OPTs is 1

#  Scenario: EHRSCAPE Get template by template_id
#    When the client uploads an OPT to the I_DEFINITION_ADL14 with template_id "encounter"
#    Then the OPT "encounter" is available from the I_DEFINITION_ADL14

#  Scenario: EHRSCAPE List all available Operational Templates
#    When the client uploads to the I_DEFINITION_ADL14 an OPT with template id in:
#      | encounter |
#      | triage |
#      | lab_order |
#    Then current count of OPTs is 3
#     And the OPT "encounter" is available from the I_DEFINITION_ADL14
#     And the OPT "triage" is available from the I_DEFINITION_ADL14
#     And the OPT "lab_order" is available from the I_DEFINITION_ADL14

#  Scenario: test list_all_opts by induction
#    Given current count of OPTs is N by induction
#    When the client uploads an OPT to the I_DEFINITION_ADL14 with template_id "vital_signs"
#    Then current count of OPTs is N+1 by induction
